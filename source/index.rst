I am a Research Assistant Professor and Software Engineer in the department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
I develop the `Ratel <https://gitlab.com/micromorph/ratel>`_ and `libCEED <https://github.com/ceed/libceed>`_ libraries.

After graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy, I served as an advanced weapon systems analyst, testing the `Air Launched Cruise Missile on the B-52 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_Test_and_Evaluation_Squadron>`_.
I was named the `Air Combat Command Junior Military Scientist of the Year <https://www.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/200165/acc-announces-2012-stem-award-winners>`_ for my work helping restore U.S. Strategic Command's confidence in the U.S. Air Force's annual accuracy and reliability report for aircraft based nuclear weapons.
After this assignment, I joined the faculty at the `U.S. Air Force Academy <https://www.usafa.edu/department/mathematics/>`_, where I taught math courses for engineering and computer science students.
I was awarded Outstanding New Instructor and Outstanding Academy Educator while at the Air Force Academy.
After leaving the Air Force, I was part of the `Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED) co-design center <https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/>`_ from 2017 to 2021 and `PSAAP Multi-disciplinary Simulation Center for Micromorphic Multiphysics Porous and Particulate Materials Simulations Within Exascale Computing Workflows <https://micromorph.gitlab.io>`_ from 2021 to 2025.
I am currently a Research Assistant Professor and Software Engineer in the department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I completed my `PhD in applied mathematics <https://www.proquest.com/docview/2572576599>`_ from the `University of Colorado Boulder <https://www.colorado.edu/amath>`_ in 2021.
My research interests include preconditioning for high order finite element-like operators and sustainable open source scientific software development.
