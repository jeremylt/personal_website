A wide variety of different individuals from a multitude of backgrounds volunteer to join the U.S. military.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth, the current Secretary of Defense, have firmly rejected tools that leaders can use to best support their people - namely anything under the umbrella of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility - going so far as to ban texts related to supporting diverse service members or the stores of these individuals from military websites and service academy libraries.
In `Alt MSS 200 <https://alt-mss-200.jeremylt.org>`_, I use the banned materials to explore the long history of the diverse individuals who have decided to serve the US and how their leadership has supported, or failed to support, them.
