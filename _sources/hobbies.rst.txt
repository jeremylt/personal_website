I enjoy playing BattleTech and run events as part of `Colorado BattleTech <https://coloradobt.org>`_.
See the `Colorado BattleTech <https://coloradobt.org>`_ website to find BattleTech players in Colorado.
I also help moderate the `Catalyst Game Labs Discord <https://discord.com/invite/catalystgamelabs>`_ community.

I've developed a lightweight narrative league and event framework with simplified logistics rules, BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes.

Mercenary's Pride is a fun project retelling Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice as a series of BattleTech scenarios and comm logs.

Skirmishers is an effort to rebuild a game system like the old `BattleTroops <https://www.sarna.net/wiki/BattleTroops>`_ game from FASA.
We are attempting to overhaul and streamline the rules while expanding them to cover additional weapons and units.
