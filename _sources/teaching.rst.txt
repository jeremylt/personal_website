Teaching Statement
********************************************************************************

My teaching has been focused on mathematics courses for engineering and computer science undergraduate students.
I have taught several semesters of Calculus I/II/III, Differential Equations, Engineering Mathematics (introduction to Linear Algebra and PDEs survey course), and Discrete Mathematics white on the faculty at the Air Force Academy.
Also, served as the course director for Calculus III, Engineering Mathematics, and Discrete Mathematics, coordinating the syllabus and exams for these courses and leading a team of the all instructors/professors for all sections in those semesters.
I was awarded Outstanding New Instructor, Outstanding Course Director, and Outstanding Academy Educator while at the U.S. Air Force Academy.
Also, while on the faculty at the U.S. Air Force Academy and as a research associate at CU Boulder, I have had several opportunities to mentor undergraduate and graduate students in research.


Classroom Time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Face to face instruction time in the classroom is a finite resource and should be used wisely.
It is an important opportunity to provide understanding or clarifications that are difficult to provide efficiently in written course materials.
I focus on three main goals, building intuition around core concepts, helping students build plans for approaching problems, and helping students troubleshoot these plans when they fail to reach the desired solution.
These goals are in line with the learning outcomes and and program objectives in CU Boulder's Computer Science BS program :cite:`BSCS2025`.
Specifically, graduates are expected to leverage foundational knowledge to design and implement solutions to problems.

There exists some research suggesting that a clear presentation of material in a lecture can increase a student's confidence in their understanding, that confidence does not necessarily translate into greater understanding, at least as measured by exams :cite:`carpenter2016effect`.
While I find a clear lecture helpful in establishing common language and some understanding of core concepts, I use in class activities to build understanding and give the students the opportunity to locate the gaps or errors in their understanding.
Historically I have relied upon MATLAB and Mathematica for these in class exercises, as well as printable worksheets.
As my research has shifted to open source software, I have been investigating leveraging tools like Jupyter notebooks :cite:`jupyter` in the classroom to replace proprietary software for in class exercises.
These notebooks, especially when hosted on a public location like GitHub prior to the lesson, provide students with a modifiable asset that frames the topics for the lesson while allowing students to take notes and experiment with the material.

Research suggests that collaborative learning strategies such as Think-Pair-Share :cite:`ningsih2019use` facilitate learning.
After introducing the lesson content in a more traditional lecture style introduction, I provide opportunities for students work on problems or experiment with the concepts, collaborating with their neighbors and raising common sticking points or areas of emphasis to the level of a discussion with the whole class.


Assessments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When designing assessments, I have three goals in mind.
The primary goal of assessments is to provide students a way to measure their progress towards course goals.
The concept of learning scaffolding does not exactly map to a university setting :cite:`stanier2015scaffolding`, but I try to build up student knowledge and capabilities throughout the semester with the goal of building independent problem solving skills in the course domain by the end of the semester.
While students and instructors can often interpret the role of feedback :cite:`beaumont2011reconceptualising`, it remains an important in helping students build their skills.

There are several demands on student's time outside of the classroom, which means that out of class assessments such as homework and projects must compete with other obligations the students have.
My second goal is to design assessments so that I make best use of the available student time.
Small in class assessments, such as quizzes, provide an opportunity for immediate feedback and I do not have to compete for student time in this environment.
From a pragmatic point of view, out of class assessments need to feel sufficiently meaningful to the students so that they allocate some of their limited time to completing the assessments.
I prefer smaller homework sets that clearly link to future in class assessments and larger collaborative projects.
I have received largely positive feedback from FCQs around these considerations, though this feedback has been from mathematics courses.

Finally, and most importantly, I try to build assessments to be fair when considering the wide range of student backgrounds and challenges.
Various underlying reasons such as unconscious bias, systemic marginalization, and different levels of anxiety over assessments, can result in drastically different results between two different students with comparable levels of understanding on a topic.
I provide a range of assessments so that students have multiple, different opportunities to demonstrate understanding of key course content.
